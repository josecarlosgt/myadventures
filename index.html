				<h2>Winter in Finland</h2>
				<img src="images/finland.jpg">
				<p>			
					During January and February, there is almost always snow in northern and eastern Finland. Even if there’s little snow in Helsinki, there’s often up to a metre or more in the northern region of Lapland.
					The winter season is definitely the best session for experiencing dog-sledding in Lapland with Siberian Huskies.
					The Siberian Husky is recognised by its thick double coat and triangular ears. Echoing the outline of a wolf, the dogs are energetic and hardy, having originated from the harsh Eastern Siberian wilderness.

					Angkor Wat is a Buddhist temple complex in Cambodia and is the largest religious monument in the world. Originally constructed as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu for the Khmer Empire,
					it was gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple towards the end of the 12th century. It was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century as his state temple and eventual mausoleum.
